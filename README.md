# ☕ Java Projects

Welcome to my **Java Projects Repository** 🎉  
I’m learning Java from **beginner to advanced**, and this repo will track my journey through small projects, practice exercises, and bigger builds along the way.  

---

## 🚀 Why this repo?
- To document my **learning progress** in Java  
- To practice building projects (not just reading theory!)  
- To grow from **beginner → advanced** step by step  
- To have a portfolio of projects I can show later  

---

## 📂 Structure
Each project will live in its own folder, with code + README.  

---

## 🎯 Learning Goals
Through these projects, I want to:
- Strengthen my **Java fundamentals** (loops, methods, OOP, etc.)  
- Practice **problem-solving** and writing clean code  
- Build from **small CLI apps → bigger applications**  
- Eventually explore **Java for backend development & frameworks**

## 🌱 About Me
I’m a student currently exploring programming. Java feels **interesting and powerful**, and this repo is my way of staying consistent and motivated by building projects.

## 📌 Note
This repo is a **learning journal** — I’m still improving!  
Suggestions, tips, and contributions are always welcome 🤝
